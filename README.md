# nfl-survivor
Repo for simulations and stats for making picks in an NFL survivor pool.

My brother, dad, and I have spent too many years on baseless theorizing about the NFL survivor pool; this is the antidote to baseless theorizing!  It is also a vehicle for having fun with python, git, and stats, of course.  

The repo currently consists of two directories:
* bettors_probs: is mainly a python file that calculates the strength of a pick based on the what other bettors are picking.  It can help to identify if the top pick is overloaded or underpicked.  
* survivor_sim: is a betting simulation framework for back-testing betting strategies
